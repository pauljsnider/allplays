# Feature: Parent Teams Dashboard Single Action Button

## Introduction
When a parent views the My Teams dashboard, two buttons perform the same action. This feature removes the duplicate so parents see only a single, clear action button.

## Requirements
1. User Story: As a parent, I want a single action button on the My Teams dashboard, so that the interface is clear and not redundant.
2. The system shall display only one action button for the duplicated parent action on the My Teams dashboard.
3. The system shall remove or hide the duplicate button without changing the underlying action behavior.
4. The system shall preserve existing navigation and functionality for the remaining button.
5. The system shall keep the layout consistent after removing the duplicate button.
6. The system shall ensure the single button remains visible and usable on desktop and mobile layouts.
