2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 are effective on the date
Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Contributions
available to a third party.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted
under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be made
available to You, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein is
intended to limit any rights reserved under copyright law.

2.4. Conditions

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 are expressly subject to the
following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
    a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source Code Form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent,
    attribution and other notices from the Source Code Form of the
    Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source Code Form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

(e) You may not add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may not provide any distribution statements for Your modifications
    that claim or imply that You are the original author of the
    modifications.

2.5. Representation about Modifications

If You distribute or communicate copies of the Covered Software or
Derivative Works, You must provide a copy of this License to each
recipient. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software
or Derivative Works that alter or restrict the applicable terms of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

3. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Covered Software and
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.

4. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Covered Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such party shall have
been informed of the possibility of such damages.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You
have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is
the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this
License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30
days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a
patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Contributor Version shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

6. General
----------

6.1. Versions of the License

The Mozilla Foundation is the steward of this License. The Mozilla
Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from
time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute Covered Software under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the Mozilla
Foundation.

6.3. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable.

example, by court order, agreement, or relevant law) that would
restrict Your ability to fully comply with the terms of this License,
then You may not distribute or communicate the Covered Software.
