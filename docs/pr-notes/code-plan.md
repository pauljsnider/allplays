# Code Role Notes (PR #33 Clock Sync)

## Objective
Determine whether additional code changes are required after positive review summary.

## Result
No further code changes required for `js/live-game.js` or `js/live-tracker.js`.

## Why
- Reviewed branch diff vs `origin/master`: only intended clock-sync changes are present.
- Review summary reported no blocking issues and aligns with code behavior.
- Additional patch would add risk without clear requirement/evidence.

## Deliverables Updated
- `docs/pr-notes/requirements.md`
- `docs/pr-notes/architecture.md`
- `docs/pr-notes/qa.md`
- `docs/pr-notes/code-plan.md`

## Success Criteria
- Branch remains merge-ready.
- Role artifacts are current for PR #33 run.
- Checks executed and recorded.
